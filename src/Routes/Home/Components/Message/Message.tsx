        Melody's Coastal Cafe strives to bring the freshest seafood as well as
        many favorites from coast to coast along with unique house options to
        Midway. We are a family owned and operated small business focusing on
        fresh food and customer service. Being a small business affords us the
        opportunity to be creative in the kitchen. We offer our mainstays as
        well as ever changing options. Melody's Coastal Cafe is our second step
        on our culinary journey. We started a Pizzeria in Marion Ohio called
        Mazzie's Pizza and became number one in a very short time. Our focus was
        the same as it is now and our customers noticed. Unfortunately, we felt
        that our creativity was limited so plans were set to sell our pizzeria
        and open a full service restaurant. After vacationing along the Georgia
        coast, we knew right away that this is where we wanted to be. We also
        value input from our customers, if you have an idea or maybe a favorite
        dish that you can't find around here, please let a waitress know and
        maybe it will end up on our specials board or even on the menu! We look
        forward to serving you. From our family to yours, thank you for your
        patronage!
